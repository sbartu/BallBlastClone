# BallBlastClone
This is a Unity made clone of the game Ball Blast. Current Controls are move with A, D or arrow keys and shoot with mouse Left-click.

A work-in-progress. This project started out as a Ball Blast clone. It is now being developed into something more than a clone. The aim is to launch the game onto mobile platforms. The game will also have complete new visuals, bgm and sound effects done by me.
